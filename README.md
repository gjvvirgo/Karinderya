# Karinderya
Is an online store simulation that is done using Bash scripting. The progam utilizes the CLI as its user interface where you are given choices on how to proceed to different parts of the program.
The online store focuses on door-to-door selling of karinderya products like silog meals, pares, lugaw, etc. Being an online store, you can register an account and shop using your credit card as its only processing payment.
Error handling and proper hierarchy of scripts are the main focus of the project. Users are identified as either the Admin or a regualr user where their passwords are stored with encryption.
